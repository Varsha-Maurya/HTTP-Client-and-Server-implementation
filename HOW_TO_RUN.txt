How to RUN

Build the server and client module
./gradlew :server:build
./gradlew :client:build


Check the resource index.html file exist. This should be a html file without subject
Subject : Updating the resource by PUT Method.
1. cat server/build/resources/main/index.html



Change to SimpleServerClient directory


Start the server
java -cp server/build/resources/main/:server/build/classes/java/main/ SimpleHttpServer 5553
You should see something like this
Started socket at port 5553
........



Test the client (Open a new terminal)
Change to SimpleServerClient directory

1. GET a resource that exist.

java -cp client/build/resources/main/:client/build/classes/java/main/ SimpleHttpClient localhost 5553 GET index.html

	You should see an index.html displayed .. make sure it doesn't have the below text in the body
	Subject : Updating the resource by PUT Method.
	This is 200 OK response



2. GET a resource that does not exist

java -cp client/build/resources/main/:client/build/classes/java/main/ SimpleHttpClient localhost 5553 GET index1.html

This will be a 404 Not Found



3. PUT a resource.

java -cp client/build/resources/main/:client/build/classes/java/main/ SimpleHttpClient localhost 5553 PUT index.html

This will be a 200 OK response



Check if the resource was updated on the server side after PUT

cat server/build/resources/main/index.html
You should now be able to see the Subject
Subject : Updating the resource by PUT Method.

We have succesfully updated the resource on the server.
